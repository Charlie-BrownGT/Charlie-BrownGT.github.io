        <br>
        <p>
           I intend to use this section to computer document projects I'm working through. If any part of the following is unclear, please direct any enquiries to me directly via the 'Contact' page.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Computing an approximation of Pi.
        </h4>
        <p>
            A simple script to compute Pi can be found in the following link <a href="https://github.com/Charlie-BrownGT/Python/blob/main/pi_computation.py">Pi Computation</a>. 
            Please note, the variable titled 'points_used' will dictate the precision to which the end result is calculated. 
            The more points used, the greater the precision. 
        </p>     
        <h4>
            Producing a hangman game.
        </h4>
        <p>
            The next mini project was to produce a game of hangman that can be executed directly from the console. 
            The code for this programme can be found on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Charlie-BrownGT/Python/blob/main/hangman_game.py">Hangman Game</a>. 
            The next step here will be to create a randomised word generator to make the game more playable. 
            I plan to update this over the coming days.
