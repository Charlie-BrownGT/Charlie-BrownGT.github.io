    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Hello, my name is Guy Carter-Richardson. I am interested in exploring nature and understanding
         developments in science when they're made. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I completed my undergraduate and masters studies in Physics at Swansea University, where I
        participated in various research projects and gained valuable insights into experimental and theoretical
        aspects of physics. These experiences intensified my interest for the subject, and I am now eager to
        take my knowledge and skills to the next level by pursuing a Ph.D. in Physics. I am excited about the potential to conduct new research, collaborate with
        researchers, and be part of an academic community.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Outside of the interests noted above, I have previously completed the regular commissioning course at the Royal Military 
        Accademy, Sandhurst, and commissioned into the Royal Signal. My employment in the British Army began in January 2018 and 
        continues today. The Army has provided many unique and challenging experiences which demand a broad array of skills. Highlights 
        here include spending two months in rural Norway completing a Nordic Biathlon training camp, teaching the next generation of 
        Royal Signals soldiers whilst working within a phase two training establishment and delivering Exercse Defence Cyber Marvel - 
        the largest live-fire cyber exercise in western europe.  
    </p>

        Having grown up in rural Suffolk, I remain a country person at heart. Time spent on the beach, cycling and walking is 
        never wasted. More information on how my time is spent can be found in both the Blog and Projects pages.
