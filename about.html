    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <br>
    <p> 
    Hello, my name is Guy Carter-Richardson. I am interested in several topics including cyber security, experimenting with a variety of software and hardware platforms and understanding their application to several fields in Physics. 
    </p>

    I completed my initial University studies with an MPhys in Physics, at Swansea University, where my thesis was titled ‘String Theory, Holography and Confinement in Quantum Chromodynamics’. This project helped to develop an understanding of String Theory, the Holographic Principle, Quantum Chromodynamics and their application when modelling strongly interacting particles. Overall this project used several multidimensional mathematical models to produce scaling factors, reflecting the interactions between these aforementioned particles. The manner with which these interactions scaled was subsequently compared to experimental observation, with an aim of iterating closer to nature.

    Having completed initial studies, I went on to attend the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, UK, in January 2018 where I completed the Regular Commissioning Course and qualified to become and Officer in the British Army. Commissioning into the Royal Corps of Signals, I completed my phase two training before posting into a variety of Field and Training Units. Highlights of my time spent in the British Army include deploying on a variety of international exercises and working around the world. These have served to develop both soft and hard skillets and set the foundations for an interest in cyber security, hardware and software.

    In August 2024 I left the British Army and began a studying for a PhD within the Nuclear AStrophysics research group at the University of York. The project I'm working on seeks to understand hot CNO breakout reactions, specifically 18Ne(alpha,p)21Na, to aid in current understanding of nucleosynthesis.

    I spent my childhood in rural Suffolk. I enjoy running, cycling, climbing and swimming.
