TRIUMF, originally the Tri-University Meson Facility, is Canada’s nuclear physics laboratory and is one of several nuclear physics facilities capable of delivering radioactive ion beams to experiments. These beams are widely used to study nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics, as they enable investigations of nuclei far from the region of nuclear stability.

The laboratory is situated on the campus of the University of British Columbia and is home to many different detector systems (TUDA, DRAGON, TIGRESS, EMMA, GRIFFIN, and many others). During a five-month attachment, a wide range of experiments were conducted, with the primary focus on experiments using TUDA (TRIUMF’s UK Detector Array) and TACTIC (TRIUMF Annular Chamber for Tracking and Identification of Charged Particles).


Some of these experiments measured the following reactions  

<sup>18</sup>F(p,α)<sup>15</sup>O,  
<sup>39</sup>K(p,α)<sup>36</sup>Ar,  
<sup>17</sup>F(α,p)<sup>20</sup>Ne,  
<sup>26</sup>Al(α,p)<sup>29</sup>Si, and  
<sup>27</sup>Al(α,p)<sup>30</sup>Si,  

with data analysis ongoing for each.
