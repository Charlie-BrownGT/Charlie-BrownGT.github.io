Nuclei in the Cosmos is one of, if not the largest conference devoted to nuclear astrophysics that takes place. It is held once every two years and is delivered by a differing host organisation with each iteration. Each conference takes place in two parts, for the less well-seasoned there is a summer school during the week prior to the main conference, then subsequently for the majority the main conference takes place.

The 2025 NIC iteration was held in Spain and was chair by Prof Jodi Jose. The summer school took place in Barcelona and was held at the Royal Academy of the Sciences and Arts, Barcelona. The main conference then migrated to Girona and was held in a substantial conference center. 

The content of the conference was broadly split across three disciplines, observational astronomy, stellar and galactic modelling and experimental nuclear astrophysics. There were contributed and invited talks spanning each discipline with specialised updates provided for each. Outside the core talks there were several other events that took place including poster sessions, excursions around the local area and a conference dinner.
