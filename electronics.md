An enthusiastic amateur at best, I do not have any formal electrical qualification. That said, basic projects based on Arduinos and Raspberry Pis are really fun. I intend to detail some things that I have made in this section, and the ongoing blog posts. Inspiration for these ideas has come from many different places, where ideas have been found from others I aim to reference their work here. 

Any feedback or further ideas on any of the content included is welcome, please feel free to get in touch.
