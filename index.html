  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>
    Hello and welcome, my name is Guy Carter-Richardson and currently live in York, North Yorkshire, UK. 
    I am currently studying a PhD within the Nuclear Astrophysics Group at the University of York. 
    I have recently left employment in the British Army where I served for six and half years as an Officer in the Royal Signals. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The ongoing PhD is focussed on understanding nuclear formation within stars, specifically CNO breakout reactions.
